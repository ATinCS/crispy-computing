This was the day after the Reindeer Project when we started to explicitly use commands

The cat jumped off the bridge, but lived because the cat is still alive. The cat met another cat at the bottom of the bridge.
They looked at each other for just a moment, but then as their eyes connected, their mood unexplicably changed. But then, a part of the bridge fell down, and both cats ran for their lives as the concrete came hurdling down. They knew they would met again, but they couldn't help but feel anger towards another for not being able to complete their interaction.
