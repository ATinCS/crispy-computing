This was the day after the Reindeer Project when we started to explicitly use commands

The cat jumped off the bridge, but lived because the cat is still alive. The cat ran home to its owner, over 40 miles away. The cat is a super cat. But the cat wasn't always this way. The cat used to have love, the cat used to have a family. The cat used to have cats that the cat could look upon fondly. All of that changed on the night at the SS New Mexico.
