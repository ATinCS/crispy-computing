This was the day after the Reindeer Project when we started to explicitly use commands

The cat jumped off the bridge, but lived because the cat is still alive. The cat ran home to its owner, over 40 miles away. The cat is a super cat. But the cat wasn't always this way. The cat used to have love, the cat used to have a family. The cat used to have cats that they could look upon fondly. All of that changed the night on the SS New Mexico.
The cat watched the waves crash upon the shore as he thought back to that night. The cat waved its head and walked on, trying to stop themselves from spiraling back into the horror of that night. When they reached the house, it was burned to the ground. 
Could it be? No. The cat knew it was impossible. But yet, there was somehow a chance. The cat couldn't help but be filled with promise as they thought back to that changing night. The screams from her late husband Sam as he played with his one ball of yarn as the lights flickered. Sam used to love his yarn. He used to have two balls of yarn, but he lost one that night.
